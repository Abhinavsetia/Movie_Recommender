USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :P
mahhh its a simple recommender system that recommendes movies based on your taste and the current movie you just watched
just downlaod the python file and run in stream lit and voila you will be able to use it 

side note the main heart of this project is the similarity.pkl file that holds the recommendation data 
the file is too LArgE to be hosted here so I am linking the steps to make it for your self and learn how it was made into existence out of thin air in a colab notebook 
LINK IS HERE BABYYYY https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EMz1kqRxhh54l4uLGA2_BDcf4WcwxRmv?usp=sharing
